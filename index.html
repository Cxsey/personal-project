<h1><font face="Arial" color="white">The Top 3 First-Person Shooter Games of all Time!</h1>


<fun>
  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Given first-person shooters are one of gaming's most beloved genres, choosing the 3 best examples is not an easy task. We need rules, but even then, for every shooter that makes the cut, another 10 fall with a headshot. On this list, we're looking at games whose central mechanic is first-person shooting. The game must be available to play right now in 2021. First-person action-RPGs such as <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, and action-adventure games like <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/deathloop">Death loop</a> are out, but multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are in. Thats the rules.<p> 

<p style="font-size: 20px">Without further ado, here are the 3 best FPS games of all time.<p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h1> <p style="font-size: 30px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No. 3 Call of Duty: Warzone</h1>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> The best battle royale. For a year, three games had a stranglehold on the genre:  <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a>,<a href="https://na.battlegrounds.pubg.com/">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</a>  and <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. But Call of Duty: Warzone has blown it wide open by twisting every element of battle <br>royale into something that feels fresh, but still familiar – exciting, but accessible.<p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">The new stuff: when you die, you get one shot to respawn by taking on another dead foe in a 1v1 fight. You get cash from completing contracts spread across the map, hunting down enemies, searching for chests, or defending an area. You can then spend that cash on loadouts, which you’ve designed between matches to suit your playstyle.<p>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Then there are the old, comforting bits: the ever-shrinking play zone, a flawless “ping” system to flag items for your teammates, and vehicles to transport you to distant circles. It’s like the greatest hits of the genre so far, all backed by Call of Duty’s tried and tested low-recoil gunplay, which gives everybody a shot at racking up the kills. You can play it solo, but jumping in with friends in Duos, Trios, or even the chaotic four-soldier squad mode is where the real fun is found.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h1><p style="text-align:right;">No.2 Destiny 2</p></h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>Format:</strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One and PC</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No one expected <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy">Destiny 2</a> to be as good as it is. And we really, really love Destiny. Instantly making the first game look like a set of prototypes, Destiny 2 improves in every area. Actually, scratch that. It evolves, taking the seed of the first game's MMOFPS idea and building a whole new, entirely richer, deeper, and broader experience around it. Now existing in a fully fleshed world, full of humanity, character, detail, and story, Destiny 2's campaign alone is enough to justify it. Entirely more curated, crafted, and built of great, in-the-moment narrative and set-piece design, it is a hell of a good Halo game.<p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">But it's only the start. With a simplified, streamlined leveling system running through every one of Destiny 2's vastly expanded activities - from story-driven side-quests to spiraling, multi-part Exotic Questlines, to treasure hunting, to exploration, to in-world lore hunting, to the brilliantly creative new Strikes and puristic, tactically reworked Crucible PvP - every single thing you want to do, however, you want to play, will push you forward. And then there's the far more freeform approach to load-outs, further energized by more creative and expressive weapon design. Even better, with the dawn of<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/newlight">Destiny 2: New Light,</a> you can access a lot of the action for free.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h1><p style="text-align:left;">No.1 Doom Eternal</p></h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>Format:</strong>PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> Doom is it. The pinnacle of FPS. Doom Eternal, the latest in the series, is everything that the genre is about, distilled into one, glorious, searing, defiant roar. It’s a force of will. An expression of creativity, speed of wits, and the ceaseless, yet thoughtful, discharge of really big, cool guns that make demons explode real good. No other game excels so completely in the arts of moment-to-moment, incendiary spectacle, and intricate, cat-and-mouse, environmental awareness. Its guns aren't just new ways of killing. Each is a multi-pronged key fitting a different situational lock, affixed to a different face of the whirling, ever-shifting Rubik’s Cube of Doom's none-more dynamic combat.<a>


  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">In many respects, it somehow manages to improve on 2016’s Doom, one of the titans of the genre and still worth playing in its own right. Ammo, health, and armor are in shorter supply, but you can pick them up from the writhing corpses of dead demons, provided you kill them in the right way (set a demon on fire with your “flame belch” and it will spew out armor when it draws its last, rasped breath). It doesn’t have 2016’s Doom SnapMap, a brilliant level design tool, but the multiplayer still harks back to the best of Quake’s lightning-fast arena brutality. If you need to give anyone a lesson in what FPS is all about, you will not find a better or more complete one than Doom Eternal.<a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
