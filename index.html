<h1><font face="Arial" color="white">The Top 3 First-Person Shooter Games of all Time!</h1>


<fun>
  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Given first-person shooters are one of gaming's most beloved genres, choosing the 3 best examples is not an easy task. We need rules, but even then, for every shooter that makes the cut, another 10 fall with a headshot. On this list, we're looking at games whose central mechanic is first-person shooting. The game must be available to play right now in 2021. First-person action-RPGs such as <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, and action-adventure games like <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/deathloop">Death loop</a> are out, but multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are in. Thats the rules.<p> 

<p style="font-size: 20px">Without further ado, here are the 3 best FPS games of all time.<p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h1> <p style="font-size: 30px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No. 3 Call of Duty: Warzone</h1>

 <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>Format:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> The best battle royale. For a year, three games had a stranglehold on the genre:  <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a>,<a href="https://na.battlegrounds.pubg.com/">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</a>  and <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. But Call of Duty: Warzone has blown it wide open by twisting every element of battle <br>royale into something that feels fresh, but still familiar – exciting, but accessible.<p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">The new stuff: when you die, you get one shot to respawn by taking on another dead foe in a 1v1 fight. You get cash from completing contracts spread across the map, hunting down enemies, searching for chests, or defending an area. You can then spend that cash on loadouts, which you’ve designed between matches to suit your playstyle.<p>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Then there are the old, comforting bits: the ever-shrinking play zone, a flawless “ping” system to flag items for your teammates, and vehicles to transport you to distant circles. It’s like the greatest hits of the genre so far, all backed by Call of Duty’s tried and tested low-recoil gunplay, which gives everybody a shot at racking up the kills. You can play it solo, but jumping in with friends in Duos, Trios, or even the chaotic four-soldier squad mode is where the real fun is found.</p>
