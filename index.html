<h1><font face="Arial" color="white">The Top 3 First-Person Shooter Games of all Time!</h1>


<fun>
  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Given Because first-person shooters are one of the most popular gaming genres, picking the finest three examples is difficult. We need restrictions, but even then, for every gunman who makes it through, another ten are killed by a headshot. On this list, we'll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. First-person action-RPGs such as <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, and action-adventure games like <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/deathloop">Death loop</a> are out, but multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are in. Thats the rules.<p> 

<p style="font-size: 20px">Without further ado, here are the 3 best FPS games of all time.<p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h1> <p style="font-size: 30px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No. 3 Call of Duty: Warzone</h1>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> The best battle royale. For a year, three games had a stranglehold on the genre:  <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a>,<a href="https://na.battlegrounds.pubg.com/">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</a>  and <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. But Call of Duty: Warzone has blown it wide open by twisting every element of battle <br>royale into something that feels fresh, but still familiar – exciting, but accessible.<p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">The new stuff is that after you die, you only have one chance to resurrect by fighting another dead foe in a 1v1 battle. You can earn money by performing contracts all across the world, hunting down adversaries, looking for loot, or protecting a region. You can then use that money to customise your loadouts in between matches to fit your playstyle.<p>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">There are also the familiar, reassuring elements, such as the ever-shrinking play zone, a faultless "ping" system for flagging goods for your colleagues, and vehicles to carry you to faraway rings. It's like a collection of the genre's greatest hits, all backed by Call of Duty's tried-and-true low-recoil gunplay, which ensures that everyone has a chance to rack up the kills. You can play it alone, but the true fun comes from teaming up with pals in Duos, Trios, or even the wild four-soldier squad mode.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h1><p style="text-align:right;">No.2 Destiny 2</p></h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>Format:</strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One and PC</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No one expected <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy">Destiny 2</a> to be as good as it already is And we are huge fans of Destiny. Destiny 2 advances on every level, making the first game look like a collection of prototypes. Actually, that's not true. It develops, taking the MMOFPS concept from the first game and creating a completely new, richer, deeper, and broader experience around it. Destiny 2's campaign alone is enough to warrant it, as it now exists in a completely fleshed-out world full of people, character, detail, and plot. It's a fantastic Halo game, much more curated, created, and built on terrific, in-the-moment narrative and set-piece design.<p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">But this is merely the beginning. Every one of Destiny 2's vastly expanded activities - from story-driven side quests to spiralling, multi-part Exotic Questlines, to treasure hunting, exploration, in-world lore hunting, to the brilliantly creative new Strikes and puristic, tactically reworked Crucible PvP - will push you forward thanks to a simplified, streamlined levelling system. Then there's the significantly more open-ended approach to load-outs, which is fueled even more by more imaginative and expressive weapon design. Even better, now that the new millennium has arrived,<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/newlight">Destiny 2: New Light,</a> you can access a lot of the action for free.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h1><p style="text-align:left;">No.1 Doom Eternal</p></h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>Format:</strong>PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> It's doom. The apex of first-person shooters. Doom Eternal, the most recent instalment in the series, encapsulates everything the genre stands for in a single, majestic, searing, rebellious yell. It's a matter of willpower. An expression of creativity, cleverness, and the unrelenting, yet deliberate, discharge of extremely huge, cool weaponry that make demons burst in a big way. No other game is as good at creating fiery, moment-to-moment spectacle and detailed, cat-and-mouse environmental awareness as this one. Its weapons aren't merely new methods to murder. Each is a multi-pronged key that fits a distinct situational lock and is affixed to a different face of the Rubik's Cube of Doom's none-the-less dynamic conflict.<a>


  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">In many ways, it manages to outperform 2016's Doom, one of the genre's titans that is still worth playing in its own right. Ammo, health, and armour are in scarce supply, but you can get them from the writhing bodies of dead demons if you kill them properly (light a demon on fire with your "flame belch," and it will spit armour when it sucks its last, rasped breath). The multiplayer harkens back to the finest of Quake's lightning-fast arena violence, however it lacks Doom SnapMap, a superb level design tool from 2016. If you need to teach someone what a first-person shooter is all about, you won't find a better or more comprehensive resource.<a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
