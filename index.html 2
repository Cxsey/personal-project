<h1><font face="Arial" color="white">The Top 3 Third-Person Moba Games of all Time!</h1>


<fun>
  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Classic MOBA games usually are presented in a third-person view because it allows players to control the whole battlefield, which is crucial for competitive MMOs. Moreover, the view from the side will enable you to see your character's appearance, which is excellent for those who love customization. Even though first-person games are much more visibly dynamic, developers of Third-Person MOBA prefers to sacrifice action to create the perfect balance of the gameplay and provide all players with the same environment.<p> 

<p style="font-size: 20px">Without further ado, here are the 3 best TPM games of all time.<p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h1> <p style="font-size: 30px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No. 3 Pokemon Unite</h1>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> In Pokémon Unite, a standard match consists of a 10-minute 5-vs-5 match in a three-lane arena. Like in any other MOBA, each Pokémon has its own specialty — a jungler to collect points, a healer for keeping everyone alive, a tank to help defend — you get the picture. You’ll face miscellaneous low-leveled Pokémon scattered throughout the field as well as members of the opposing team to collect Aeos energy that can be used to score against your competitors. As you fight and win battles in real time, your character levels up, evolves, and learns new attacks. Evolutions reset after every match, though, so the long-term training of mainline Pokémon games is absent here.<p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Generally speaking, previous knowledge of the mainline Pokémon games will not help you here. There are no elemental weaknesses. There’s no background lore that informs the way the world works (say goodbye to gym battles). And no, there is no “catching ’em all.” Despite hundreds of Pokémon to choose from and the large size of the rosters in MOBAs like League of Legends, Pokémon Unite is still new and building its cast as it goes.<p>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Pokémon Unite pulled me into the competitive MOBA world and all the esoteric knowledge that comes with it. I looked up videos for how to play my character. I learned different strategies for early-game and late-game and the differences between the two. I began using terms like “jungler,” “laner,” and “gank” with my friends.

Because it’s Pokemon, there are a lot of what you might call “casual players.” (A joke proliferated recently on TikTok about how the game is full of kids.) And while it’s obviously fine for people to dip their toes in the MOBA waters with a property they’re familiar with — I did, after all — Pokémon Unite is at its best when everyone in the match is somewhat dedicated to getting better.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Brawl Stars is the new rage between the mobile gaming community. The multiplayer game was designed by Supercell, a Finish mobile game development company that has previously released some of the most successful mobile games in history, such as Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. <p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Brawl Stars is a third-person shooter game in which you play as the brawler of your choice and have the opportunity to participate and compete against other brawlers or AI in different events organized by Brawl Stars. Each event has its unique objective that further motivates the players to participate in order not to miss out on valuable segments for the player profile growth.

In the game, you have the chance to collect many brawlers and then work on their rankings. The character level is increasing individually, so you would have to invest time in each brawler’s growth. The opponent matching is based on the brawlers' strength level to give every player an equal chance to win. You can play with other players or create a  team with your friends and fight for the trophies and your spot in the game. The game contains a moderate use of violence, and it is rated PG 13+ by the game makers.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> The Last of Us is one of the rare beloved games of the past decade that not only didn’t demand a sequel, but actively seemed to resist the idea of one. Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original’s third-person action/stealth gameplay.

<a>


  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">I can’t tell you much about some of Part 2’s best aspects, but not because I don’t want to – I’m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I’ll speak about its story in largely general terms.<br><br>One of Part 2’s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead.
